# Active-Directory


<h2>Description</h2>

By setting up this enviornment, I was able to get an understanding of an Active Directory. I created a Domain Control VM. After installing the Active Directory, some of my first few steps were setting up a new Admin Organizational Unit and adding Users to that Organizational Unit. I used 1000 randomly generated names and used PowerShell in order to add each as a New User.  <br/>

I created a second VM that was to be used to mimic a corporate setting, this specifically was used to test user permissions. I connected the second VM to connect to the domain from the first VM.

<br />

From here I tested out user permissions, disabiling accounts, and reset passwords and how those actions translated to the user. 

<h2>Programs Used </h2>

- <b>Oracle VM VirtualBox </b> 
- <b>Windows 10</b>
- <b>Windows Server 2019 </b>

<h2>Problems I ran into and how I solved them</h2>
<b>When setting up the second VM, I kept getting met with a server set up. I deleted and re-set up the VM at least 6 times before realizing I wasnâ€™t getting Windows 10, because I forgot to download the Windows 10 ISO and was using Server 2019. My error was using Server 2019 and was setting up the exact same parameters that I was using for the Domain Control VM, so of course it was going to produce the same result. Once I figured out what the issue was, I set up Windows 10 with no issue at all and was able to use the Client VM to test user permissions.
