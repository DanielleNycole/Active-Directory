# Active-Directory


<h2>Description</h2>

By setting up this enviornment, I was able to get an understanding of an Active Directory. I created a Domain Control VM. After installing the Active Directory, some of my first few steps were setting up a new Admin Organizational Unit and adding Users to that Organizational Unit. I used 1000 randomly generated names and used PowerShell in order to add each as a New User.  <br/>

I created a second VM that was to be used to mimic a corporate setting, this specifically was used to test user permissions. I connected the second VM to connect to the domain from the first VM.

From here I tested out user permissions, disabiling accounts, and reset passwords and how those actions translated to the user.
